                <h3>OOPs Concepts in Prolix</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Class</li>
                  <li>Objects</li>
                  <li>Polymorphism</li>
                  <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Prolix Class</h3>
                <p>
                  A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the
                  blueprints or prototypes from which objects are created. It is
                  a logical entity that contains a number of attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To comprehend the concept of classes, let's delve into a
                  scenario where you need to manage information about various
                  employees in a company. If you were to use a simple list to
                  represent each employee, you might assign the first element
                  for their name, the second for their department, and the third
                  for their hire date. However, as the number of employees
                  grows, it becomes challenging to discern which element
                  corresponds to which attribute, leading to confusion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now, imagine there are 50 employees, each with additional
                  details like job title, salary, and performance rating. Using
                  a list would result in an unwieldy structure, making it
                  difficult to keep track of the information coherently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is where classes come into play. Instead of relying on a
                  list, you can create a class named 'Employee' with attributes
                  such as name, department, hire date, job title, salary, and
                  performance rating. Each employee can then be represented as
                  an instance of this class, providing a structured and
                  organized way to manage and access information. Classes offer
                  a clear and intuitive framework for handling complex data,
                  making it easier to extend and maintain as the scope of
                  information grows.
                </p>
                <h5>Some points on Prolix class:</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Classes are created by keyword <code>class</code>.</li>
                  <li>Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.</li>
                  <li>
                    Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the
                    colon (<code>:</code>) operator.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Class Definition Syntax:</h5>
                <pre>
class ClassName :Attribute1 &lt;value&gt; :AttributeN &lt;value&gt;;
</pre
                >
                <h5>Creating an Empty Class in Prolix</h5>
                <pre>class Employee;</pre>
                <h3>Prolix Objects</h3>
                <p>
                  In programming, an object is a fundamental concept
                  representing an entity that combines both state and behavior.
                  This concept is not limited to abstract ideas but extends
                  seamlessly to real-world entities such as a mouse, keyboard,
                  chair, table, or pen. These objects encapsulate attributes or
                  properties (state) and actions or methods (behavior) that
                  define their identity and functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even the most basic data types in programming, like integers
                  and strings, are treated as objects. For instance, the number
                  12 is an object, and so is the string "Hello, world." This
                  object-oriented perspective allows programmers to apply a
                  unified approach to various elements, making code more
                  organized and intuitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Going a step further, more complex data structures like arrays
                  and dictionaries are also treated as objects. Arrays, serving
                  as objects, can contain a collection of other objects,
                  facilitating data organization. Similarly, dictionaries act as
                  objects that establish key-value pair relationships, offering
                  flexibility in representing connections between different
                  elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's worth noting that every instance of a basic data type is,
                  essentially, an object. Each object comes with its own set of
                  attributes and methods, providing a cohesive way to interact
                  with and manipulate data. This object-oriented approach is
                  pervasive in programming and plays a crucial role in building
                  modular, scalable, and maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In summary, the concept of objects is ingrained in
                  programming, offering a systematic way to model both simple
                  and complex entities. Whether you're dealing with a single
                  integer, a string, or more intricate data structures, the
                  principles of objects persist, contributing to a coherent and
                  efficient programming paradigm.
                </p>
                <h5>An object consists of:</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>State:</strong> It is represented by the attributes
                    of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Behavior:</strong> It is represented by the methods
                    of an object but in Prolix it is usually manipulating
                    attributes and running code. It also reflects an object's
                    response to other objects.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Identity:</strong> It gives a unique name to an
                    object and enables one object to interact with other
                    objects.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  To understand the state, behavior, and identity let us take
                  the example of the class employee.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The identity can be considered as the name of the employee.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    State or Attributes would represent the characteristics or
                    information associated with each individual employee.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Behaviors would represent the actions or operations that an
                    employee can perform or undergo.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Creating an Object</h5>
                <pre>Employee $obj;</pre>
                <h5>Class object reference</h5>
                <p>
                  In Prolix, class's name is a conventional pre-defined object
                  of instance attributes in a class. It is used to reference the
                  instance (object) on which a attribute is affected. This
                  object is implicitly passed when a attribute is affected on an
                  object, allowing the attribute to interact with the specific
                  instance's attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Prolix, the programming paradigm centers around a unique
                  concept where objects are defined primarily by their
                  attributes, and there are no explicit methods. The behavior of
                  an object is determined by manipulating its special attributes
                  directly. This attribute-centric approach serves as the
                  driving force for code execution and functionality within the

                  This specific attribute, referred to as "initial_state,"
                  undergoes activation upon the instantiation of an object from
                  a class. Designed with precision to encapsulate a particular
                  facet of the object's initial configuration or behavior, this
                  attribute dynamically becomes active and assumes a
                  predetermined state as the object is created, thereby
                  establishing a foundational status for the newly instantiated
                  entity.

                <h5>Creating objects with affectable attributes</h5>

                <p>
                  In the context of Prolix, when a class incorporates a special
                  attribute named <code>__edit__</code>, a distinctive mechanism
                  is established. This mechanism is designed to create new
                  affectable attributes, and when an object is instantiated from
                  this class, the <code>__edit__</code> attribute serves as a
                  callback or handler. Notably, as object attributes undergo
                  editing, the name of the edited attribute is automatically
                  stored in another designated attribute named
                  <code>__key__</code>. This enables developers to dynamically
                  track and respond to attribute modifications by referencing
                  the <code>__key__</code> attribute, providing a powerful and
                  extensible tool for managing changes in object state within
                  the Prolix programming paradigm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The driver code starts by creating two instances of the
                  Employee class: John and David. The ask_name attribute is
                  affected in both instances (<code>$John.ask_name</code> and
                  <code>$David.ask_name</code>), causing each employee to print
                  a statement with its name.
                </p>
                <pre>
class Employee :name none :__edit__ {
    $math:eq $Employee:__key__ "ask_name";
	if $math:result {
        $io:write "My name is " :write $Employee:name :write "\n";
	}
};

# Driver code
Employee $John :name "John";
Employee $David :name "David";
$John:ask_name;
$David:ask_name;
</pre
                >
                <p>Expected output:</p>

                <h3>Prolix Polymorphism</h3>
                <p>
                  Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
                  programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be
                  treated as objects of a common type. This concept promotes
                  code reusability, flexibility, and abstraction.
                </p>
                <h5>Polymorphism and Object-Oriented Programming</h5>
                <p>
                  Polymorphism has vast applications in Object-Oriented
                  Programming. Let’s now create a simple class with polymorphic
                  affectable attributes:
                </p>
                <pre>
class Animal
    :type "animal"
    :__edit__ {
    $math:eq $Animal:__key__ "display_type";
    if $math:result {
        $io:write "This is a " :write $Animal:type :write "\n";
    }
};

Animal $Dog :type "dog";
$Dog:display_type;
</pre
                >
                <p>
                  In this example, we create a basic class called
                  <code>Animal</code> with a affectable attribute
                  <code>display_type</code> that prints the type of the animal.
                  We then create a new <code>Dog</code> object from the
                  <code>Animal</code> class and modify its type to
                  <code>Dog</code>. When the Dog's
                  <code>display_type</code> attribute is affected, it now prints
                  <code>This is a dog</code>.
                </p>
                <h5>Polymorphism with Shared Affectable Attribute Names</h5>
                <p>
                  Polymorphism allows different objects to share affectable
                  attribute names. Let’s illustrate this with another example
                  using our <code>Animal</code> class:
                </p>
                <pre>
Animal $Cat :type "cat";
$Cat:__edit__ {
    $math:eq $Animal:__key__ "display_type";
    if $math:result {
        $io:write "This is a cute " :write $Animal:type :write "\n";
    }
};
$Dog:display_type;
$Cat:display_type;
</pre
                >
                <p>Expected output:</p>
                <pre>
This is a dog
This is a cute cat
</pre
                >
                <h3>Prolix Encapsulation</h3>
                <p>
                  Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
                  programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and
                  affectable attributes (methods) that operate on the data into
                  a single unit known as a class. The primary purpose of
                  encapsulation is to hide the internal implementation details
                  of an object and expose a controlled and well-defined
                  interface for interacting with it.
                </p>
                <pre>
class Circle :__edit__ {
    $math:eq $Circle:__key__ "calculate_area";
    if $math:result {
        $math:mul $math:pi $Circle:radius :mul $math:result $Circle:radius;
    }
};
